<p style="font-size: 0.5vw; top: 53%;">The second assignment was more challenging because you had to come up with a certain event and then play it out into a interactive website, app, etc. This assignment was still fun because it allowed me to get better expeirence at designing websites. There is also a list of references from this assignment below:</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.5vw; top: 65%;">As we know both articles talk about the industry-standard design tools & the current scale and state of the internet. I believe the Abbe's position on the article she wrote is in support on the fact of how we humans have caused problems for the earth and how it might be to late to fix these things. There are a couple solutions stated in Abbe's article, knowing them and trying to relate them to the other article is simple as saying that the solutions can be wide spread throughout the world using the internet. The solutions could cause an uproar around the world making it a global issue giving more meaning and light to what we should do to help the world. In the second article written by John Patrick-Hartnett I also believe that he is in support behind the article's main topic. But the solutions provided would not be able to be of any help when considering the problem in Abbe's article.Reading the article written by Becca Abbe, I was able realize a couple things that not only affect me as a designer but as a human living in this world. So taking everything that abbe said and understanding it, in consideration how it affects me as a designer I realize how troublesome the future holds for me. This applies to when I create something and whether the materials can be accessed or if what I create is something that is truly needed.</p>

Lialina's said that the definition of the universal user is; "The Universal user is not a super user, not half a hacker. It is not an exotic type of user (Lialina, 2012)." as well as; "A Universal User’s mind set means to liaise with hardware and software. Behavior that is antipodal to the “very busy” user. This kind of interaction makes the user visible, most importantly to themselves (Lialina, 2012)." I especially like how she said that the universal user is not a super user, not half a hacker, or an exotic type of user, because even though they are vague statements they still express an in-depth way of thinking when defining the universal user. I do think it is a useful category for understanding Schwulst’s argument advocating for individual websites over platforms because I see a direct correlation with understanding the universal user and advocating for individual websites over platforms. Although others will think differently I see it, for example Schwulst said, "To those creative people who say “I don’t need a website,” I ask: why not have a personal website that works strategically, in parallel to your other activities... (Schwulst, 2018)." Bringing the direct correlation of how one views and understands themselves, in Lialina's story, into connecting the way of creating a personal website, in Schwulst's story, can be view as a shared connection between the two stories. I have used computers my whole life and will probably use them for the rest of my life. I have always fascinated myself with building my pc and creating different parts that could create the best and most powerful one. Even though I never got into to creating new parts I was able to build my own pc and I am still trying to improve it as much as possible. I use my computer like anybody else for school or the internet or to even wind down and relax. "Users were seen and marketed as people who’s real jobs, feelings, thoughts, interests, talents — everything what matters — lie outside of their interaction with personal computers (Lialina, 2012), is a good quote to support how I feel as to what kind of computer user I am. It shows how users were marketed to be enticed to want personal computers and I am one of these people who were goaded in getting one. I don't regret it and I never will.</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.5vw; top: 85%;">Treating ones as passive consumers is not a new thing it is something that happens with a lot of big companies. They do whatever the hell they want without even considering how people think. They would rather make money than a decent product for people to actually think is innovative. I understand where they are coming from because it may cost a lot of money and to much time, but at least have some decency to ask a couple of people on the street instead of a resource group that you paid to be there in front you answer questions they have no idea about. But for me I would rather take more time and energy to build a proper concept for people to enjoy and take the time to talk to people who have valid complaints about on going issues. I know this for a fact because I have been their shoes, I built my own computer and I have so many problems and I have no idea how to fix them because of the user interface. So to answer the question full on, I would probably ask as many people as possible who have had the same issues as me with this kind of stuff, and get them to give me proper ideas that could help better the user interface.</p>
